# TennisTally
A little React Native app developed for practice. It can be used to keep track of scoring in a tennis game.

## Demo

## Running Locally
### Android Studio
1. Install Android Studio
2. Open Android Studio
3. Click "Configure"
4. Click "AVD Manager"
5. Click "Create Virtual Device..."
6. Pick a phone and click next (I generally use Pixel 4 since it includes the play store)
7. Use the system image with release name "R" and API Level >= 30
8. Click "Next" and "Finish"
9. Start the emulator

### Clone the repository
1. In the terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/jaaywags/TennisTally.git`
2. In the terminal, run `cd TennisTally`

### Starting the Project
1. In the terminal, run `npm i`
2. In the terminal, run `npx react-native run-android`

The previous command should automaticall install and run the app on the emulator. As you make changes, they should automatically reflect in this emulator as well.

#### Note
I wrote these steps from memory. Did not test them. There may be other steps needed.
